# SpringMVC

Download ZIP, store locally and copy to netbeans

Note: I made changes to litrealty DB so better off importing the sql file to get the exact databse or you'll run into problems

Java class "main" is the main controller where all the routing happens

Java class "Agent" is EntityClass created from DB

Java class "AgentService" is the database manipulation stuff

Java class "ExceptionClass" is exception stuff (Tested with postman think it's working)

Supports english + spanish + french, bean validation

Note: Edit functionality just adds a new user, doesn't actually edit because too lazy
